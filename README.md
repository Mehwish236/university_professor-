# university_professor
This project aims to create a relational database to efficiently manage information about university faculty, their affiliations with various organizations, and their respective universities. 
The database schema includes normalized tables for universities, professors, organizations, and affiliations.
Referential integrity constraints are implemented to ensure data consistency and accuracy. 
This allows for efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling administrators to track faculty profiles, analyze research collaborations, and support decision-making processes within the university. 
The project emphasizes a well-structured database design to facilitate data analysis and provide a valuable resource for the university community."
